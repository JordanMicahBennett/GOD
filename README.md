DESCRIPTION
============================================
The [temporal difference horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman_equation) ~ [C<sup>∞π</sup>(R<sup>kπ</sup>)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316586028_Thought_Curvature_An_underivative_hypothesis), compounds some [hierarchical causal fabric](http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2035&context=etd) ~ [η](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_numerical_simulation).

AIM AND CONCLUSION
============================================
I [haven't any belief](http://nonbeliefism.com), and thereafter, I haven't any belief in God or gods. 


However:


[God is scientifically redefinable](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316662636_A_scientific_redefinition_of_God_by_an_atheist), such that man occurs in the aforesaid redefinition.

As such, [this model](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/God) seeks to non-trivially contribute to the development of artificial general intelligence, as underlined in the god-redefinition document prior. Crucially, I don't claim that [this model](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/God) is nearly complete/sensible enough to describe AGI, although I seek that the "[Supersymmetric Artificial Neural Network](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/Supersymmetric-artificial-neural-network)", an essential part of this model, while optimally contributing to AGI research in the representation learning space, perhaps become as influential as for example, the [convolutional neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) reasonably invented by Yann Lecun.
